00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
As mention before, there are

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,150
a lot of pre-trained models available directly in the software.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:11,685
Let's take a quick look at what pre-trained models are and how they are used.

4
00:00:11,685 --> 00:00:16,335
Pre-trained models referred to models where retraining has already occurred.

5
00:00:16,335 --> 00:00:20,730
This can lead to high even cutting-edge accuracy and

6
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,125
avoids the need for large-scale data collection and long costly training.

7
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:28,785
Given knowledge of how to preprocess inputs and handle the outputs,

8
00:00:28,785 --> 00:00:31,995
you can plug these directly into your own app.

9
00:00:31,995 --> 00:00:35,520
In the toolkit, pre-trained models refers specifically to

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,890
the Model Zoo containing pre-trained models already converted using the model optimizer.

11
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,985
As such, you can use these models directly with the inference engine.

12
00:00:45,985 --> 00:00:48,020
You seen this slide before,

13
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,080
but here's just a quick visual reminder on how you can feed

14
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,445
the pre-trained model directly into the inference engine.

15
00:00:54,445 --> 00:00:59,870
Before we get into the full set of pre-trained models available in the OpenVINO toolkit,

16
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:04,410
let's cover some of the basics of computer vision models first.
